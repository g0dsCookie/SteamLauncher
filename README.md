# SteamLauncher

SteamLauncher is a plugin for [WinCommandPalette](https://github.com/DarkIrata/WinCommandPalette).

This plugin adds all your currently installed games as command.
Just hit your shortcut keys, type in the game name and hit enter.

# Reload games

Because there is no API available to add/remove commands, you have to restart WinCommandPalette to reload the game list.
